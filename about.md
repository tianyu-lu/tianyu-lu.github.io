I'm an undergrad in Bioinformatics, Computational Biology and Computer Science at the University of Toronto, working with Philip Kim on machine learning guided protein design for cancer therapeutics. I also lead University of Toronto's iGEM dry lab team, where we work on optimizing PETase, a plastic-degrading enzyme.

Beyond protein design, I'm interested in gene regulatory networks and biology inspired design and computing. My research goal is to efficiently search for combinations of biologics to perturb a cell's transcriptional regulation network, thus enabling precise and controllable cell engineering.
