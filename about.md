<img src="/assets/images/profile.png">

I'm a Bioengineering PhD student at Stanford University. Previously I was a Junior Machine Learning Scientist at [ProteinQure](https://www.proteinqure.com/). I studied Bioinformatics, Computational Biology and Computer Science at the University of Toronto. I worked with [Alan Moses](http://www.moseslab.csb.utoronto.ca/) on models of gene regulatory networks using machine learning models for differential equations. The project later pivoted to using random embeddings as baselines for protein sequence embeddings. Previously, I worked with [Philip Kim](http://www.kimlab.org/) on machine learning guided protein design for cancer therapeutics. I also lead [University of Toronto's iGEM team](https://igemtoronto.ca/) as Co-President, where we work on optimizing PETase, a plastic-degrading enzyme.  

Broadly I'm interested in analogies between biology and computation, with a focus on algorithms for protein design such as the intersection of directed evolution and model based optimization. My research goal is to model and sample from the _p(sequence, structure, function)_ distribution.

When I'm not at the computer I might be making things with flour, or trying to sight read Rachmaninoff's second piano concerto for the hundredth time.
