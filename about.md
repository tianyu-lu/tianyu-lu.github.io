<img src="/assets/images/profile.png">

I'm a Bioengineering PhD candidate at Stanford University. Previously I was a Junior Machine Learning Scientist at [ProteinQure](https://www.proteinqure.com/). I studied Bioinformatics, Computational Biology and Computer Science at the University of Toronto where I worked with [Alan Moses](http://www.moseslab.csb.utoronto.ca/) on models of gene regulatory networks using machine learning models for differential equations and [Philip Kim](http://www.kimlab.org/) on machine learning guided protein design for cancer therapeutics. I also led [University of Toronto's iGEM team](https://igemtoronto.ca/), where we worked on optimizing PETase, a plastic-degrading enzyme.
