title: About me

<img src="/assets/images/profile.png">

I'm a 4th year undergraduate student in Bioinformatics, Computational Biology and Computer Science at the University of Toronto, working with Alan Moses on models of gene regulatory networks using machine learning models for differential equations. Previously, I worked with Philip Kim on machine learning guided protein design for cancer therapeutics. I also lead University of Toronto's iGEM dry lab team, where we work on optimizing PETase, a plastic-degrading enzyme.  

Broadly I'm interested in analogies between biology, information theory, and computation, e.g. directed evolution and model based optimization. I'm also interested in emergence of complexity and its connections with modularity in the context of gene regulatory network evolution. My research goal is to efficiently design combinations of biologics to perturb a cell's transcriptional regulation network, thus enabling precise and controllable therapeutics.  

When I'm not at the computer I might be making things with flour, or trying to sight read Rachmaninoff's second piano concerto for the hundredth time.
